# Coding-Challenge

## Challenges:
1. Create a function called `capital_indexes`. This function should accept a single argument, a string. The function should return a list containing the indexes of all the uppercase letters in the string. For instance, if we call `capital_indexes("Hello, World!")`, it should return the list [0, 7].
2. Construct a function called mid which accepts a string as its argument. Your function should identify and return the middle character of the string. If the string doesnâ€™t have a middle character (i.e., its length is even), your function should return an empty string. For instance, calling `mid("abc")` should yield `"b"`, while calling `mid("aaaa")` should yield `""`.
